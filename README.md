- 👋 Hi, I’m Albert Tran
- 🌱 I’m currently working as a full-stack developer. My responsibilities include developing and updating software programs in C# and .Net to implement API services for monitoring the health status of deployed applications in multiple Kubernetes clusters using Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki.
- 🌱 I'm currently enrolled in an online Kubernetes Certified Application Developer (CKAD) course and plan to take the CKAD exam in the next few months.
- 🌱 As part of a side project, I am developing a mini-shop application. The frontend is built with Vue.js and JavaScript, the backend with Node.js and Express, and MySQL is used for the database.
- 🌱 I have over 10 years of experience in embedded software development for the aerospace industry and radar development.
- 👀 I’m interested in surfing the web, listening to music, performing lion dances, and learning new technologies.
- 💞️ I’m seeking collaboration opportunities on any software development.
- 👀 I'm a member of both IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu (IEEE-HKN), the honor society of IEEE, and IEEE.
